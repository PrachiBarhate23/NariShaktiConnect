# 🌸 Nari Shakti Connect

Empowering women in the informal sector through safety, awareness, and accessible resources.

# 🚀 About the Project

Nari Shakti Connect is a mobile-first web application designed to address unreported workplace harassment, lack of awareness about rights, and inaccessibility of support resources faced by women in India’s informal sector.

The platform provides a discreet, simple, and reliable companion for women workers—helping them report incidents (simulated), learn their rights, access NGOs/legal aid directories, and stay safe with actionable tips.

This is not just a student MVP—it has the potential to grow into a scalable startup idea, with clear social impact and market viability.

# 📈 Why This Works as a Startup

- Large Addressable Market: Millions of women in India’s informal workforce face similar challenges.

- Unique Value Proposition: Combines discretion, simplicity, and accessibility—filling a real gap in current reporting/support mechanisms.

- Scalability: MVP currently runs on static content, but can easily expand into a full SaaS with real NGO integration, multilingual support, verified reporting, and AI-based guidance.

- Impact & Trust: Acts as both a social-good platform and a sustainable business model, where NGOs, legal bodies, and even corporates could integrate for CSR/ESG alignment.

# 📜 Limitations (MVP Stage)

No backend → Reports are not actually sent, only simulated.

Static NGO/Legal Aid directory → Currently hardcoded with demo entries.

No real-time chat/call integration (simulation only).

# 👩‍💻 Future Scope

Real anonymized reporting system integrated with verified NGOs/legal bodies.

Dynamic multilingual support (regional languages, voice assistance).

Partnership model with NGOs, government bodies, and startups in the women’s safety domain.

Expand into a trusted B2B/B2C product for workplace compliance and safety.
